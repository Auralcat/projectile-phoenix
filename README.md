# Projectile-phoenix

<!-- Cool image goes here -->

This project aims to offer quicker navigation to Phoenix-related files at first:

- [X] Find controller
- Find context
- Jump to test
- Run mix tasks

The idea is to have a single navigation responsibility, offloading other features to other packages.

## Why not use Alchemist?
Alchemist offers navigation between Phoenix files with a minor mode, but it has been unmaintained for some time now.
