## What we need for version 0.1
The idea is to get stuff running and try things out in practice as soon as possible, with confidence in the development process.

- [X] Set up test suite
- Implement navigation functions
    - [X] Find controller
    - [X] Find view
    - [ ] Find template
    - [ ] Find seed file (`priv/repo/seeds.exs` )
    - [ ] Find test file
    - [ ] Find mix tasks

## Version 1.0
Should have stable specs and (maybe) a better UI.
